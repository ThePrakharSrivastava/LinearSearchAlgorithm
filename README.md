# Linear Search

* Linear search is a brute force method and is not used in case of large datasets. It has a time complexity of O(n).

* Search is carried out from the left, start from the first element in the array. It goes on till the element is found.

* Carrying out a linear search on an array of 683 elements to search an element at index 682 took 996600 nanoseconds.
